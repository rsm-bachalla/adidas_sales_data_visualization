# Adidas Sales Data Analysis and Financial Modeling

This project focuses on analyzing Adidas sales data with a special emphasis on financial modeling and forecasting. The analysis was conducted using Python for data preprocessing and visualization, and Power BI for interactive dashboards.

## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to gain insights into Adidas's sales performance, analyze trends, and create financial models for forecasting and decision-making.

## **Contents**
1. **Python Notebook** (`Sales_data.ipynb`):
   - Code for cleaning and preprocessing the data
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Key metrics computation
   - Data export for Power BI

2. **Cleaned Data** (`cleaned_sales_data.csv`):
   - Preprocessed and cleaned dataset for use in visualizations and modeling.

3. **Power BI Dashboard** :
   - Interactive visualizations for trends, costs, sales performance, and forecasting.
